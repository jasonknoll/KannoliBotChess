# Sawtooth - Chess Bot
### An attempt to learn how chess engines work
I've known about chess since I was a little kid, but up until recently I never played it. It's a fascinating game with limitless possibilities for creativity and strategy. 

I discovered the world of chess engines and chess bot competitions - I want to participate. Although machine learning will provide much more depth, Sawtooth uses **alpha-beta pruning** in a minmax search to find its moves.
